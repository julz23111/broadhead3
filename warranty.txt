Warranty
JEBCO LLC stands its Broadhead Buddy. We offer a 1 Year Manufacturing Defect Warranty from the date of purchase to the original customer. While we strive to provide exceptional service, our liability under this warranty is limited.
Customer is responsible for ensuring proper maintenance of the Broadhead Buddy to prevent any issues that may void the warranty. Normal wear and tear, misuse, or damage caused by factors outside of our control are not covered under this warranty. 
Seller warrants to the original customer that all products shall be free from defects in material or workmanship at the time of shipment. Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy is limited to either (a) replacement of the defective part or product or at seller’s option, (b) return of the product and refund of the purchase price. We are not liable for any consequential or incidental damage.
Notify us by email describing the defect and provide photos of that defect along with a copy of your receipt.  Our team will then assess the issue and determine appropriate remedy.
