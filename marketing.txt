Headline: Leave no broadhead behind. The Broadhead Buddy recovers broadheads or other arrow points without damaging them. No more wrestling with your arrows, prying a broadhead back and forth or hammer and chiseling away material to get them out. These methods risk breaking an arrow shaft, bending the head’s ferrule, or accidentally striking the blade and breaking them.

Body:
You’ve invested in the best broadheads for a reason. Don't let a stuck broadhead end its use in a tree. The Broadhead Buddy extraction tool is specifically engineered for the task and designed for durability, performance, and reliability. This is the ultimate arrow point puller for all archers and the only tool you need for reclaiming your investment, saving you money from buying a replacement broadhead.
Features that justify the premium price:
•	Precision CNC machining: Each tool is meticulously machined from a single billet of 304 stainless steel and 6061 aluminums, eliminating weak points and ensuring perfect function every time. 
•	Engineered mechanical advantage: Uses controlled positive axial force multiplication. By applying a relatively small force to the knob the Broadhead Buddy generates a very large linear pulling force, allowing you to easily extract deeply embedded broadheads from even the densest objects. 
•	Multi-functionality: This isn't a one-trick pony. Broadhead Buddy is compatible with most fixed and mechanical 2,3 and 4 blade Broadheads; works on field points too. It can also save your expensive arrow shaft inserts. Don’t grab and damage the insert with pilers, this prevents them from fitting in the arrow correctly and true again.  Instead use the included piece of all-thread rod. Thread it into the back of the insert and pull it like you would a broadhead.
•	Crafted for a lifetime of performance: Every detail is engineered for uncompromising performance and maximum longevity. Premium constructed stainless steel and aluminum make it corrosion resistant and far superior molded alternatives.
